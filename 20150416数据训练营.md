##mtcars
Motor Trend Car Road Tests

###Description

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).

###Usage

mtcars
###Format

A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.

[, 1]	mpg	Miles/(US) gallon<br />
[, 2]	cyl	Number of cylinders<br />
[, 3]	disp	Displacement (cu.in.)<br />
[, 4]	hp	Gross horsepower<br />
[, 5]	drat	Rear axle ratio<br />
[, 6]	wt	Weight (lb/1000)<br />
[, 7]	qsec	1/4 mile time<br />
[, 8]	vs	V/S<br>
[, 9]	am	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)<br>
[,10]	gear	Number of forward gears<br>
[,11]	carb	Number of carburetors



##attach
Attach Set of R Objects to Search Path

###Description

The database is attached to the R search path. This means that the database is searched by R when evaluating a variable, so objects in the database can be accessed by simply giving their names.

###Usage

attach(what, pos = 2L, name = deparse(substitute(what)),
       warn.conflicts = TRUE)
       
##plot
Generic X-Y Plotting

###Description

Generic function for plotting of R objects. For more details about the graphical parameter arguments, see par.

For simple scatter plots, plot.default will be used. However, there are plot methods for many R objects, including functions, data.frames, density objects, etc. Use methods(plot) and the documentation for these.

###Usage

plot(x, y, ...)

###type
what type of plot should be drawn. Possible types are

"p" for points,

"l" for lines,

"b" for both,

"c" for the lines part alone of "b",

"o" for both ‘overplotted’,

"h" for ‘histogram’ like (or ‘high-density’) vertical lines,

"s" for stair steps,

"S" for other steps, see ‘Details’ below,

"n" for no plotting.

##abline
Add Straight Lines to a Plot

###Description

This function adds one or more straight lines through the current plot.

###Usage

abline(a = NULL, b = NULL, h = NULL, v = NULL, reg = NULL,
       coef = NULL, untf = FALSE, ...)
###Arguments

a, b<br>
the intercept and slope, single values.

untf	
logical asking whether to untransform. See ‘Details’.

h	
the y-value(s) for horizontal line(s).

v	
the x-value(s) for vertical line(s).

coef	
a vector of length two giving the intercept and slope.

reg	
an object with a coef method. See ‘Details’.

...	<br>
graphical parameters such as col, lty and lwd (possibly as vectors: see ‘Details’) and xpd and the line characteristics lend, ljoin and lmitre.

##detach

Detach Objects from the Search Path

###Description

Detach a database, i.e., remove it from the search() path of available R objects. Usually this is either a data.frame which has been attached or a package which was attached by library.

###Usage

detach(name, pos = 2L, unload = FALSE, character.only = FALSE,
       force = FALSE)
###Arguments

name	
The object to detach. Defaults to search()[pos]. This can be an unquoted name or a character string but not a character vector. If a number is supplied this is taken as pos.

pos	
Index position in search() of the database to detach. When name is a number, pos = name is used.

unload	
A logical value indicating whether or not to attempt to unload the namespace when a package is being detached. If the package has a namespace and unload is TRUE, then detach will attempt to unload the namespace via unloadNamespace: if the namespace is imported by another namespace or unload is FALSE, no unloading will occur.

character.only	
a logical indicating whether name can be assumed to be a character string.

force	
logical: should a package be detached even though other attached packages depend on it?

##lm
Fitting Linear Models

###Description

lm is used to fit linear models. It can be used to carry out regression, single stratum analysis of variance and analysis of covariance (although aov may provide a more convenient interface for these).

###Usage

lm(formula, data, subset, weights, na.action,
   method = "qr", model = TRUE, x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE,
   singular.ok = TRUE, contrasts = NULL, offset, ...)

##par
Set or Query Graphical Parameters

###Description

par can be used to set or query graphical parameters. Parameters can be set by specifying them as arguments to par in tag = value form, or by passing them as a list of tagged values.

###Usage

par(..., no.readonly = FALSE)

<highlevel plot> (\dots, <tag> = <value>)
###Arguments

...	
arguments in tag = value form, or a list of tagged values. The tags must come from the names of graphical parameters described in the ‘Graphical Parameters’ section.

no.readonly	
logical; if TRUE and there are no other arguments, only parameters are returned which can be set by a subsequent par() call on the same device.
