##data.frame {base}	
Data Frames

###Description

This function creates data frames, tightly coupled collections of variables which share many of the properties of matrices and of lists, used as the fundamental data structure by most of R's modeling software.

###Usage

data.frame(..., row.names = NULL, check.rows = FALSE,
           check.names = TRUE,
           stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors())

default.stringsAsFactors()
###Arguments

####...	
these arguments are of either the form value or tag = value. Component names are created based on the tag (if present) or the deparsed argument itself.

####row.names	
NULL or a single integer or character string specifying a column to be used as row names, or a character or integer vector giving the row names for the data frame.

####check.rows	
if TRUE then the rows are checked for consistency of length and names.

####check.names	
logical. If TRUE then the names of the variables in the data frame are checked to ensure that they are syntactically valid variable names and are not duplicated. If necessary they are adjusted (by make.names) so that they are.

####stringsAsFactors	
logical: should character vectors be converted to factors? The ‘factory-fresh’ default is TRUE, but this can be changed by setting options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE).

##na.fail {stats}	
Handle Missing Values in Objects

###Description

These generic functions are useful for dealing with NAs in e.g., data frames. na.fail returns the object if it does not contain any missing values, and signals an error otherwise. na.omit returns the object with incomplete cases removed. na.pass returns the object unchanged.

###Usage

na.fail(object, ...)
na.omit(object, ...)
na.exclude(object, ...)
na.pass(object, ...)
###Arguments

####object	
an R object, typically a data frame

####...	
further arguments special methods could require.
